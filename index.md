### CPSC 120

* Lab 2 [https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-02-jandales14]

    Lab 2 as whole was a favorite as this was the first time really using C++. I was learning a lot about the new language and was having fun doing so. This lab really opened my eyes to what I would be doing that semester. This was also my first time actually coding something so that was also a really cool experience.

* Lab 6 [https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-06-kanishk-h-and-jason-a]

    Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite because it was really challenging. I had a hard time figuring out loops as it was the first time I was using them. In the end me and my partner figured it out and I was really proud of the both of us.

* Lab 9 [https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-09-katherinenjason]

    Lab 9, part 2 was a favorite as it was also very challenging. Turning the .txt files into vectors was a little confusing and the functions were difficult to figure out how to use. However, in the end me and my partner were able to figure it out and it was nice knowing that we could figure something out so difficult.
